# Practise Personal Website

This is a practise for my personal website I created when I first started learning web development. The website is still under construction, but has played an important role in expanding my understanding of web technologies and web development practises.

## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to not only demonstrate myself as a person, but to also put into practise the skills I have acquired whilst learning web development.

## Getting Started
* Clone this repository into your terminal.
* Run index.html.

## Prerequisites
All you will need to access this website is to clone this repository and run index.html, which will then run the website in your web browser.

## Deployment
As this website is for practise, there are currently no plans for deployment. With this being said, I have plans to develop a fully functional web application for my personal profile.

## Built With
This web application was built in Sublime Text with the following web technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
